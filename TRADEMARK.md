## TRADEMARK NOTICE

### Project Tick™ Trademark and Brand Policy

#### 1. Ownership of the Marks

Project Tick™, the Project Tick name, the Project Tick logo, and all related branding elements (collectively, the “Marks”) are trademarks of **Mehmet Samet Duman**.

All rights in the Marks are reserved.

This Trademark Policy governs use of the Marks independently of any open source license applicable to source code, documentation, or other materials.

#### 2. Relationship to Open Source Licenses

Each repository under the Project Tick namespace is licensed under its respective open source license (e.g., MIT, BSD, Apache-2.0, GPL, MS-PL, etc.).

These licenses govern the use, modification, and redistribution of source code only.

Open source licenses do **not** grant:

* Rights to use the Project Tick name

* Rights to use Project Tick branding or trade dress
* Rights to imply affiliation, endorsement, sponsorship, or official status

Trademark rights are separate from copyright licenses.

#### 3. Permitted Uses

The following uses are generally permitted without prior written permission:

1. Factual references (e.g., “compatible with Project Tick”).
2. Accurate description of unmodified official releases.
3. Non-commercial commentary, research, educational, or journalistic references.

Permitted use must not:

* Create confusion regarding origin
* Suggest sponsorship, approval, or endorsement
* Present modified versions as official releases

#### 4. Modified and Redistributed Versions

Open source licenses permit modification and redistribution of source code.

However:

* Modified versions must not use the Project Tick name or logo in a way that implies official status.

* Derivative works must clearly indicate that they are modified versions.
* Use of phrases such as “Official,” “Certified,” or similar terminology is prohibited without authorization.
